This script adds/removes RAM or CPU to/from Virtual Machine using vCloud PI interface. Messages from operations are logged to syslog.
Adding RAM/CPU works when VM is powered on, but removing resources will work only if the VM is powered off. For this we have setRAMrestart/setCPUrestart options.

To make script running, you need to o two things:
-------------------------------------------------
1. On vCloud enable "Virtual CPU hot add" and "Memory hot add" on Virtual Machine (vCloud -> right click on the VM -> properties)

2. Get VM ID from vCloud:
  a. get the token:
      curl -i -k -H "Accept:application/*+xml;version=1.5" -u "<LOGIN@ORGANIZATION" -X POST "<VCLOUD>/api/sessions" | sed -n '4p' | awk -F: '{ print $2 }' | sed 's/^ *//g'

  b. with the token, get organization ID:
      curl -i -k -H "Accept:application/*+xml;version=27.0" -H "x-vcloud-authorization: <TOKEN>" -X GET <VCLOUD>/api/org/
      
      (from the output find Org href=...)
      
  c. with the token and organization ID get vdc ID:
       curl -i -k -H "Accept:application/*+xml;version=27.0" -H "x-vcloud-authorization: <TOKEN>" -X GET <VCLOUD>/api/org/<ORGANIZATION ID>/
    
      (from the output find something with vdc in the path)
      
  d. with the token and vdc ID get the list of vApps:
        curl -i -k -H "Accept:application/*+xml;version=27.0" -H "x-vcloud-authorization: <TOKEN>" -X GET <VCLOUD>/api/vdc/<VDC ID>
        
        
Now, put vApp ID and other stuff in the script:
-----------------------------------------------
      # vcloud url:
      url = '...'

      # VM ID in vCloud notation:
      vApp = '...'

      # credentials
      username_and_org = '...'
      password = '...'

      # limit of loop execution to prevent infinite loop
      limit=15

      # for how long I should wait before starting VM (in restart option)
      wait_before_start=15
